# plan9-misc
Mostly small gui programs and tweaks to build files.

clock.amber.c - 9front's clock.green.c, but with amber.
rio.amber - 9front's rio.amber.tgz appears to not build. So this is rio.green.tgz, but with amber.
rio-themes - Some themes to be used with http://www.ftrv.se/14. Just default rio and amber.
s9.sdf.mkfile - Some tweaks to the mkfile so s9fes https://www.t3x.org/s9fes/index.html will install on sdf's 9p.
xmas_tree.scm - Scheme Xmas Tree.
